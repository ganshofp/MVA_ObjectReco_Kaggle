# Birds Image Classification

Kaggle competition with the rest of the "Object recognition and computer vision" class as part of the MVA master, on a subset of the Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 bird dataset. The objective was to produce a model that gives the highest possible accuracy on a test dataset containing the same categories.
